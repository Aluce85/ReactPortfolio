# ReactPortfolio

This is my react portfolio, I ran out of time so wasn't able to finish it the way I would have liked to.

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. I tried to implement a moving background to add some flash to it but it ended up messing up most of the page and I didnt have time to fix it before it was due, but i am excited to get it working in the next few days!
